This file contains the mail template for a resend of a partner that has been detected
The following variables will be substituted:
${PRODUCTNAME}: The productname of the AS2 server
${HOST}: The host where the AS2 server runs at
${EXISTING_MESSAGE_INIT_TIME}: Init time of the original message that has been already processed
${MESSAGEID}: Message id of the message that has been resend
${SENDER}: Message sender

[SUBJECT]
Message resend detected - message has been rejected


[BODY]
Your partner ${SENDER} sent a message with an id that has been already processed 
by the system. The message receiver is your local station ${RECEIVER}.
The AS2 system has not processed this message, it has been rejected.
This could have the following reasons and requires manual investigation:

*The message ids that are generated by ${SENDER} are not unique 
    - this is a problem on your partners side
*${SENDER} has resend a message with an already used message id. The reason could 
    be that your message delivery notification has not been received or could not be parsed. 
    Resending messages with an already used message id is always risky because it could 
    result in double delivery of messages, the AS2 protocol does not prescribe mandatory
    how to deal with resend and already processed messages.

Date of the already processed message: ${EXISTING_MESSAGE_INIT_TIME}
Message id of the already processed message: ${MESSAGEID}

Please have a look at your AS2 system to check this transaction. Please contact ${SENDER}
as he might have an other transaction state of this transaction as you have.
