To upgrade the mendelson opensource AS2 from a previous installed version please perform the following steps:


1.Make a backup of the installation directory of the mendelson opensource AS2. If anything happens during the update this backup 
        could be copied over the installation and will restore the full state before the upgrade


2.Delete the jlib directory found below the installation directory.


3.Upgrade (Windows) 
-----------------
Please download the installer, execute it and let it install directly over the existing installation. There are some personal 
        files that must not be overwritten. The installer will probably ask if you want to overwrite them, answer with NO to keep your 
        personal settings.
Please ensure that the used keystore files have the default password - else please change this back to the default.
Afterwards start the mendelson opensource AS2 server. It will perform some database upgrades. If any additional steps are 
        required the program will inform you.
--> Done for Windows


Upgrade (non-Windows)
---------------------
Please download the .zip archive and extract it directly over the existing installation. 
If your version to upgrade is v61 or older please skip the following and jump to the special update section below.
Please copy the following files from your backup (step 1) to the installation:
*certificates.p12 (your keystore for encryption and signature)
*jetty10/etc/keystore (your TLS keystore)
*jetty10/jetty.config (your embedded HTTP server basic settings)
*jetty10/etc/jetty.xml (your receipt web server detailed settings)
*notificationtemplates/* (your personal templates for the mail notification, skip this step if you haven't modified them)
*.passwd (if you upgrade from b39 or younger)
*Remove all jlib/* subdirectories and files from your old installation and replace them by the jlib/* files and
    subdirectories found in the .zip

*Modify the start script if required (path to java installation etc)
*Please ensure that the used keystore files have the default password - else please change this back to the default.




Update of mendelson opensource AS2 from mendelson opensource AS2 b61 or older versions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since mendelson AS2 b63 (2023) there is bundled the jetty v10 - in earlier versions this was the jetty v6 (<= b45) 
   or jetty v9 (<= b61). 
If you are updating the mendelson opensource AS2 from mendelson opensource AS2 b61 or older please perform the following steps:

*Please copy your old TLS keystore file from jetty/etc/keystore (<= b45) or jetty9/etc/keystore (<= b61) into the 
   new directory jetty10/etc
*Please do _not_ copy the old jetty/etc.jetty.xml or jetty9/etc/jetty.xml into the new directory jetty10/etc. The structure of
   the jetty.xml has been changed in jetty 10 and this would result in incompatibilities.
*Please review and modify the file "jetty10/jetty.config" for the port settings etc. Normally there is no need anymore to modify 
   the file jetty10/etc/jetty.xml. Anyway if you need to add special features for the embedded jetty 10 which are not covered
   by the new jetty10/jetty.config configuration file you might also modify the file jetty10/etc/jetty.xml.
*Please ensure that the used keystore files have the default password - else please change this back to the default.
