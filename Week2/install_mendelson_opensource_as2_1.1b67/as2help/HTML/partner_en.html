<p><img src="../images/as2_partner.png" width="653" height="404" alt="Partner"></p>
<p>Participants of every AS2 communication are you (localstation) and your trading 
  partners. This is why the interface uses two different icons for these parties:</p>
<table width="75%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="4%"><object data="../images/localstation.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="20" height="20"></object>
    </td>
    <td width="96%">Local station (you), local</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><object data="../images/singlepartner.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="20" height="20"></object></td>
    <td>Trading partner (TP), remote</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The configuration of a partner differs depending if it is the local statation 
  or the trading partner. The partner configuration GUI will not show some options 
  if you are the TP/localstation. Please don't be confused about this.</p>
<p>There has to be defined always min one local station for the server. You could 
  create as many local stations as you wish, this allows to present different 
  identities.<br>
  Please remember that most settings in this panel belong to the remote partner. 
  That is why the number of visible tabs is reduced if you have configured a partner 
  as &quot;local station&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="settings" id="settings"></a> Settings</h2>
<p>The partner settings define the behavior of the server depending on a partner 
  in many ways: The following paragraph describes these settings:</p>
<p><strong>Misc:<br>
  <br>
  </strong>Every TP and the local stations use an internal name (for the as2 server 
  only) and a public AS2 id. The AS2 id must be sent to your partners to allow 
  them to identify your messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Security:<br>
  </strong><br>
  This product supports encryption and digitial signature of AS2 messages. There 
  are different encryption algorithm and signature algorith. You and your trading 
  partner have to chose the same algorithms else the communication will fail.<br>
  The security settings are not only valid for outbound messages. If you have 
  for example setup &quot;3DES&quot; as encryption inbound messages of this partner 
  are expected to be encrypted with this algorithm, too - else the transaction 
  will be rejected with the hint <span class="techDescription">insufficient-message-security</span>.<br>
  The signature algorith is not only used to sign the AS2 messages but also requested 
  as hash function for signed MDN.<br>
  <br>
  Please make an appointment with your partner about these AS2 communication settings.<br>
  Please remember that the SHA-2 hash algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-256) are 
  not part of the standard AS2 protocol. They are part of the AS2 optional profile 
  &quot;SHA-2&quot;. This optional profile has been introduced at the end of 2012 
  and has been implemented in the first AS2 products in the middle of 2013. If 
  your parter has an older AS2 software or does not support this optional profile 
  you must not use SHA-2 as hash alrorithm for successful data transfer.<br>
  mendelson AS2 supports the optional profile SHA-2 since &quot;mendelson AS2 
  2013 build 274&quot;, released in 09/2013. </p>
<p>Please remember that there are two different types of signature algorithm available, 
  these are the standard SHA-n algorithm and the SHA-n algorithm using the RSASSA-PSS 
  signature scheme for outbound signatures. The reason could be found in RFC 4056:</p>
<p><em>1.1. PSS Algorithm</em></p>
<p><em> Although there are no known defects with the PKCS #1 v1.5 [P1v1.5]<br>
  signature algorithm, RSASSA-PSS [P1v2.1] was developed in an effort<br>
  to have more mathematically provable security. PKCS #1 v1.5<br>
  signatures were developed in an ad hoc manner; RSASSA-PSS was<br>
  developed based on mathematical foundations.</em></p>
<p><br>
  There are some signature algorithms that are generally considered to be no longer 
  secure and therefore may not be recommended. <br>
  Ultimately, it is always up to your discretion (as with all parameters) and 
  coordination with your partner whether you want to use them. <br>
  To visualize our non-binding recommendations, we use the following icons with 
  the following meanings when displaying and selecting signature algorithms:</p>

<p>The signature of the MDN attempts to use the same signature scheme as it was 
  used for incoming AS2 messages. Thus, if an incoming message is signed with 
  SHA-1 (RSASSA-PSS) and SHA-1 is listed as a possible signature algorithm for 
  the MDN in the Disposition Notification Options (HTTP header) of the incoming 
  AS2 message, SHA-1 (RSASSA-PSS) is used as signature for the outbound MDN.</p>

      Encryption Standard (DES) cipher algorithm three times to each data block. 
      The original DES cipher's key size of 56 bits was generally sufficient when 
      that algorithm was designed, but the availability of increasing computational 
      power made brute-force attacks feasible. Triple DES provides a relatively 
      simple method of increasing the key size of DES to protect against such 
      attacks, without the need to design a completely new block cipher algorithm.

<p><strong>Algorithm Identifier Protection Attribute</strong></p>
<p>In contrast to X.509/PKIX, the cryptographic message syntax (CMS) used in AS2 
  is vulnerable to algorithm substitution attacks. <br>
  In an algorithm substitution attack, the attacker changes either the algorithm 
  or the parameters of the algorithm and thus changes the result of the signature 
  check. This allows the attacker to leverage the signature check. <br>
  The attribute &quot;Algorithm Identifier Protection Attribute&quot; now contains 
  a copy of the corresponding algorithm identifiers so that they are protected 
  by the signature or authentication process.</p>
<p><br>
  <span class="fontRed">If you do not use this attribute (for compatibility reasons 
  with old AS2 systems, for example), this corresponds to the same security level 
  as if you were not using a data signature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><br>
  MDN (Message Delivery Notification):</strong></p>
<p><img src="../images/as2_msg_mdn.png" width="667" height="320" alt="MDN"></p>
<p>The AS2 protocol requires a receipt acknowledgement for every sent message. 
  This ack is called &quot;<strong>MDN</strong>&quot; (<strong>Message Delivery 
  Notification</strong>). A transaction is completed if the MDN to sent data arrives. 
  There are two different types of MDN transfers: sync MDN and async MDN. Mainly 
  it depends on the message receiver with mode to select. If you chose the sync 
  MDN mode the MDN is sent on the same HTTP connection the message has been sent/received 
  on. In this case there is no information needed to which URL a MDN should be 
  sent to. If you chose the async MDN the AS2 messages contains information of 
  where to send a MDN to. Because of this the sender of a message has to define 
  a MDN URL in this case.<br>
  The EDIINT standard does not define on how long to wait for a async MDN before 
  setting the transaction on error. Mainly this time is set to 30 min but this 
  could be defined in the AS2 server settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Directory polling:</strong></p>
<p>There are different possiblities to send messages to the AS2 server in this 
  product. You could directly copy the data to an outbound 
  directory of a defined partner. The poll manager for every partner will pick 
  up these files, enwrapp them into AS2 messages, encrypt and sign them (is requested). 
  This setting defines the bahavior of the poll manager per partner.<br>
  Its possible to define file patterns or a list of files that should be ignored 
  by the polling process - this is required if you are using a non atomic copy process to put the files there instead an atomic move. The patterns are comma separated, the default value is <strong>&quot;*.tmp,*.temp"</strong>. <br>
  These are the special characters in the patterns that will create regular expressions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>"*"</strong> will be replaced by the regexp <strong>".*" </strong></li>
  <li><strong>"?"</strong> will be replaced by the regexp <strong>"." </strong></li>
  <li><strong>"."</strong> will be replaced by the regexp  <strong>"\." </strong></li>
</ul>
<p> Every file name in the poll directory that matches these patterns will be 
  ignored.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Hint:</strong><br>
  Even if it might be possible to set the poll interval to under 1s this makes 
  no sense and pushes up the CPU to 100%. Because of this the poll threads will 
  always wait a minimum of 1s, even if you configure the poll thread to wait 0s. 
  Polling a directory includes getting all file entries of a directory and sorting 
  them by date which is a slow process (file IO). Because the poll processes are 
  running per relationship and not perpartner the number of poll processes could 
  increase fast if you are using a huge amount of local stations, please have 
  a look at the following table which gives an idea of that: </p>
<table width="700"border = 1>
  <th width="255" height="24">Number of local stations</th>
    <th width="204">Number of partner</th>
    <th width="250">Number of directory poll processes</th>
  
  <tr> 
    <td height="24">1</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td><strong>10</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="24">2</td>

</table>
<p>With the checkbox for directory polling you can switch off the poll process 
  of the directory. This can help to reduce the file IO, and you can also temporarily 
  interrupt an automatic transmission to a specific partner. <br>
  Since this interrupts the automated process of directory monitoring in the case 
  of a permanent configuration, you would either have to send the data manually 
  (via &quot;Send file to partner&quot; in the AS2 client) or you would have to 
  send the send requests in your respective flow via the command line.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Receipt:</strong></p>
<p>It's possible to transmit the filename of a AS2 transmisson. Anyway this is 
  not standardized and not every AS2 product supports this option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HTTP authentication:</strong><br>
  <br>
  Beneath message encryption, digital signature, TLS (transport layer security, 
  SSL) its also possible to define an additional passwort for the HTTP receipt. 
  This could be set here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Notification:</strong></p>
<p>If you use message quota you could setup the quota notification here.<br>
  <em><strong>Attention:</strong></em><br>
  You have to activate this configuration possibility in the settings first (&quot;Interface&quot;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Header:</strong></p>
<p>Allows to reconfigure the HTTP headers of the AS2 messages and add new ones. 
  Please be careful using these settings because its possible to stop the communication 
  to a partner if you overwrite some reuqired AS2 Headers.<br>
  <em><strong>Attention:</strong></em><br>
  You have to activate this configuration possibility in the settings first (&quot;Interface&quot;). 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Send:</strong></p>
<p>The AS2 messages are sent and received via HTTP or HTTPs. To perform this you 
  need the receipt URL of your TP for every communication. Please contact your 
  TP to get these data.<br>
  AS2 is a point to point protocol - both trading partners systems have be online.<br>
  <br>
  Please do not change the default settings for subject and content type of the 
  message unlike you TP requests to change them.<br>
  It's also possible to set the content transfer encoding per partner. This is 
  &quot;binary&quot; by default, you could also set &quot;base64&quot;.<br>
  There are multiple AS2 versions out with different features. If your TP uses 
  a AS2 solution &gt;= AS 1.1 you may compress the message data to reduce the 
  sent data size.<br>
  <br>
  The system transfers the original file name automatically. For this purpose, 
  a separate entry is created in the AS2 message structure in the payment header:<br>
  <span class="TechDescription"><br>
  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=myfile.txt</span></p>
<p>Since RFC 822 does not allow characters &gt; ASCII 127 to be used in MIME headers, 
  the filename is encoded when necessary. For example, for the file &quot;&ouml;.txt&quot; 
  the file name would be transmitted in the following format (RFC 2047, UTF-8, 
  B) and would have to be interpreted accordingly on the other side if it is to 
  be used:</p>
<p><span class="TechDescription">Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;=?UTF-8?B?w7YudHh0?=&quot;</span></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><strong>Postprocessing:</strong> </p>
<p>You can trigger post-processing processes after receiving or sending data. 
  For detailed information, see the section <a href="postprocessing_en.html">Postprocessing</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Setting up a new connection<br>
  <br>
</h2>
<p>When you create a new connection, you must know the communication
  parameters of your partner and tell him yours. The mendelson AS2
  server can help you with a data sheet of communication parameters, you
  can automatically create it and send it to the partner. In this form
  there are all the required parameters, the partner can fill in his own
  and return the data sheet.<br>
</p>
<p>You should start inputting your contact data for your local station
  (tab "Contact" in the partner management). To create the data sheet
  please navigate to "File-Create communication data sheet". There are
  some additional details of your system that are required (receipt URL, comment), then a PDF is generated that contains editable PDF fields on the
  partner site that can be filled out by the partner:</p>
<br>
<p><img alt="Communication data sheet" src="../images/datasheet.png"><br>
The PDF will have some attachments - these are the certificates that are required for your partner to establish an SSL connection and encrypt message to you or verify your digital signature. If you are using Mac OS X and you are using the standard PDF preview reader you will see no attachments - this is not supported there. Please install the acrobat reader to read the document in this case.</p>
