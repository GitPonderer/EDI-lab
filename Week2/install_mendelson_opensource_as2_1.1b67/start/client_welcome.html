    <div class="featureBox">
      02/2017 mendelson opensource AS2 1.1 b51<br><br>Enhancement:<br>*The key 
      generator could generate EC keys now<br>*Support for RFC 5753 (Use of 
      Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Algorithms in Cryptographic Message 
      Syntax (CMS))<br>*Support for signature generation and validation using 
      EC keys and certificates<br>*The certificate manager displays the trust 
      chain of every certificate now<br>*The &quot;Toggle refresh&quot; button now 
      disables the log output, too<br><br><br>Changes:<br>*The Algorithm 
      Protection Attribute could be disabled per partner as there are several 
      older AS2 programs out that could not deal with it<br><br><br>Fixes:<br>*On 
      receipt of multiple payloads there were generated n tabs in the client 
      but the content was always the one of the first payload<br>*The manual 
      send process of data did not transfer the right original filename<br>*EC 
      keys were not displayed in a proper way in the certificate manager<br>*The 
      original filename is kept now on (manual) transaction resend<br>*The JKS 
      export of private keys failed<br>*The p7b import of certificates did not 
      work with more than 2 certificates in the chain<br>*The p7b export of 
      the certificate manager did not export the whole trust chain<br>*The 
      passwords had not been set for JKS key import - this resulted in a 
      &quot;cannot recover key&quot; message<br><br><br><br>Updates (3rd party 
      libs):<br>*Update to BC 1.54 (crypto API, see 
      https://www.bouncycastle.org/)<br>*Update to HSQLDB 2.3.4 (Database)<br>*Update 
      to javamail 1.5.6<br>*Update to Apache MINA 2.0.16<br><br><br><br>02/2016 
      mendelson opensource AS2 1.1 b49<br><br>Enhancement:<br>*Certificate 
      import: If your partner sent you a zip archive with a certificate the 
      import function will import the certificate by first extracting it.<br>*System 
      maintenance: You could setup the process to delete messages not only 
      after n days but also after n hours or n minutes<br>*Columns could be 
      added and hidden in the transaction overview - persistent<br>*Partner 
      management: Partners are marked in the partner tree now if there is a 
      problem during the setup (e.g. 2 times the same AS2 id)<br><br>Changes:<br>*MD5 
      is no longer allowed in TLS (RFC7465) - this has been set up in the 
      jetty.xml file<br>*Several log messages have been modified<br>*Icons of 
      the client have been reworked<br><br>Fixes:<br>*The HTTP request log has 
      been added again - it wasn't included in b47 because of the jetty update<br>*The 
      sync MDN date was in wrong format for the french version - the date has 
      to be always in US locale to prevent language specific special 
      characters in the date<br>*If empty HTTP headers have been received by 
      the mendelson AS2 it answered with HTTP 500. It's not clear if this is a 
      problem of the mendelson AS2 as empty HTTP headers are not allowed. 
      Anyway it will work with these headers now.<br>*It was possible to 
      import two certificates with the same alias which leaded to some weird 
      situations that e.g. the software displayed that a certificate has been 
      expired and the users can't find it<br>*The directory poll waited a full 
      period before taking over changes. Means if you set this value to once a 
      day it could have least a day before the new values has been taken<br>*A 
      directory poll of 0s was possible - but the result of this setting was 
      100% CPU and high file IO. Now the min value is 1s even if you enter 0s. 
      We recommend 30s as min value!<br>*An AS2 id with slashes (that exists!) 
      prevented the system from writing the transaction status files<br>*The 
      outbound sync MDN was always signed in error case<br><br>Updates (3rd 
      party libs):<br>*Update to BC 1.53 (crypto API, see 
      https://www.bouncycastle.org/)<br>*Update HTTP components to 4.5 (see 
      http://hc.apache.org/)<br>*Update to HSQLDB 2.3.3 (Database)<br>*Update 
      to javamail 1.5.4<br>*Update to commons Pool 2.2.3 and commons dbcp 
      2.1.1: DB Pool libs<br>*Update to Commons Codec lib 1.9<br><br><br><br>01/2015 
      mendelson opensource AS2 1.1 b47<br><br>Enhancement:<br>*It's possible 
      to clone an existing partner in the partner management now<br>*You could 
      create a communication data sheet (editable PDF) now in the user 
      interface. The PDF contains all settings of your selected local station 
      and requests the settings of your partners system. The PDF contains the 
      required certificates as attachment. Just send it to your partner to ask 
      him for his communication parameters and deliver yours. Please remember 
      that the standard MAC OS PDF reader does not support PDF attachments. 
      Please install an other PDF reader if you are using this OS.<br>*The 
      partner panel contains additional fields for the partner address and 
      partner contact now, this is written to the communication data sheet if 
      created<br>*You could manually resend more than a single transaction now 
      (this will create new transactions). Please select multiple transactions 
      in the transaction overview. Right mouse on it opens the related context 
      menu.<br>*The private key generator found in the certificate manager 
      supports SHA256WITHRSA now. This allows to sign your certificates using 
      SHA-2 as some providers are moving away from SHA-1. Please remember that 
      there might be AS2 programs out that cannot work with these certificates 
      - please clarify this first before signing your certificates with SHA-2.<br><br>Changes:<br>*Removed 
      all RMI code (which was slow) - the communication between the receipt 
      servlet and the AS2 processing unit is based on apache MINA now. This 
      results in higher processing message throughput and port 1099 is no 
      longer used by the AS2 server.<br>*The directory &quot;_rawincoming&quot; is 
      managed by the system maintenance process new - it will delete old 
      messages there. If you setup the system maintenance process (which is 
      recommended) it will care for the old files in this directory.<br>*The 
      underlaying HTTP server (jetty v6) has been replaced by jetty v9. The 
      reason is that it is possible now to disable transport layer security 
      protocols (e.g. SSLv3) and weak ciphers/hash algorithms. If you are 
      updating from a mendelson AS2 with underlaying jetty v6 there are some 
      manual changes required - please refer to update_howto.txt which is part 
      of the package. SSLv3 and some weak ciphers are disabled now by default. 
      Please edit the file jetty9/etc/jetty.xml to change these defaults or to 
      add other weak ciphers which should be no longer supported by your AS2 
      instance. The new jetty instance will be found in the directory &quot;jetty9&quot; 
      after an update/clean install. But as always: Please do not rely on the 
      transport security only, always encrypt and sign your data!<br>To 
      disable ciphers please add them to the &quot;ExcludeCipherSuites&quot; section in 
      jetty9/etc/jetty.xml:<br>&lt;Set name=&quot;ExcludeCipherSuites&quot;&gt;<br>&lt;Array 
      type=&quot;String&quot;&gt;<br>&lt;Item&gt;SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA&lt;/Item&gt;<br>&lt;/Array&gt;<br>&lt;/Set&gt;<br>To 
      disable SSL protocols add them to the &quot;excludeProtocols&quot; section 
      jetty9/etc/jetty.xml:<br>&lt;Set name=&quot;excludeProtocols&quot;&gt;<br>&lt;Array 
      type=&quot;java.lang.String&quot;&gt;<br>&lt;Item&gt;SSLv3&lt;/Item&gt;<br>&lt;/Array&gt;<br>&lt;/Set&gt;<br><br><br>*The 
      JAVA VMs DNS caching has been set to 60s (Windows installer only). This 
      is a setting done in the file jre/lib/security/java.security. Please set 
      it manually if required and you are on a non windows system, add the line<br>networkaddress.cache.ttl=60<br>In 
      older versions this was set in the program code but it turned out that 
      this was useless as these settings are read once on JVM start and 
      setting them later in the program code has no effect at all.<br><br><br>Fixes:<br>*If 
      a certificate had been exported to p7b format it contained the end 
      certificate only - without the trust chain certificates<br>*There were 
      problems if the certificate was not in PEM but additional BASE64 encoded 
      if you tried to import it. This is very uncommon - we encountered this 
      only once.<br>*Importing certificates in p7b format now imports the full 
      trust chain and the end certificate. In older versions just the end 
      certificate was imported.<br>*If the send partner was unknown the system 
      always sent a sync MDN with the error message &quot;unknown partner&quot; - even 
      if the sender requested an async MDN<br>*The certificates have not been 
      sorted proper by their date in the display of the certificate manager.<br>*The 
      sent MDN was always signed - even if the partner requested an unsigned 
      MDN<br>*A SQL injection was possible in the message delete procedure - 
      that was also the reason that some transactions could not be deleted by 
      the system.<br><br>Updates:<br>*Update to BC 1.51 (crypto API, see 
      https://www.bouncycastle.org/)<br>*Update HTTP components to 4.3.5 (see 
      http://hc.apache.org/)<br>*Update servlet API to 3.1 (comes with the new 
      jetty v9 webserver)<br>*Updated jetty to v9 (unterlaying HTTP server, 
      see http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/)<br>*Update to Apache MINA 2.09 
      (client-server interface, see https://mina.apache.org/)<br><br><br><br>02/2014 
      mendelson opensource AS2 1.1 b45<br>Enhancement:<br>*mendelson 
      opensource AS2 contains certificate manager for SSL/encryption/signature 
      now - it is no longer needed to edit the underlaying keystores using a 
      third party tool like portecle<br>*Impoved the community versions 
      documentation<br>*The user interface (security tab) contains a hint now 
      that the mendelson AS2 will never change a keystore password - these 
      settings are just to work with keystores that have been edited using 
      thried party tools<br><br>Updates:<br>*Update to BC 1.50 (crypto API)<br>*Update 
      to HSQLDB 2.3.2 (Database)<br><br><br><br>09/2013 mendelson opensource 
      AS2 1.1 b43<br>Enhancement:<br>*Support of the AS2 profile SHA-2, this 
      supports the hash functions SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512<br><br>Updates:<br>*Update 
      to BC 1.49 (crypto API)<br><br><br><br>08/2013 mendelson opensource AS2 
      1.1 b41<br><br>Enhancement:<br>*A resend is also initiated now if the 
      server response was HTTP 502, 503 or 504 - not even only if the 
      connection attempt failed<br>*The test mail for the mail connection 
      setup contains the mail server settings now<br>*Mail server connections 
      for the notifications support startSSL/SSL now<br><br>Changes:<br>*All 
      timestamps in the db are changed to UTC - this allows to use one 
      database instance in different timezones<br><br>Fixes:<br>*MDNs are 
      signed using SMIME 3.2 instead of SMIME 3.1 - this leads to 
      incompatibility with some AS2 products<br>*The directory poll always 
      took a single file even if the file poll number was set to 0<br>*It was 
      impossible to send a mail under linx if the host has not been defined in 
      /etc/host<br>*The filenames in _rawincoming have not been unique under 
      some circumstances<br><br>Updates:<br>Update HTTP components to 4.2.5<br>Update 
      to BC 1.48 (crypto API)<br>Upgrade to HSQLDB 2.2.9 (database engine)<br><br><br><br>04/2012 
      mendelson opensource AS2 1.1 b39<br><br>Enhancement:<br>*A retry of the 
      connection attempt has been implemented if it fails the first time<br>*MDN 
      Auto recovery on server start has been added: If the server has been 
      shut down and there are pending outbound MDN they are send after the 
      server is up again and the MDN wait time has not been expired<br>*If a 
      transaction has been manually resend the original name is kept now and 
      the transaction is marked as &quot;resend&quot;<br>*A new temporary 
      directory for files is used, this is below the installation directory 
      now and no longer the systems temp directory<br>*A new web interface is 
      included. The password file for the web access access is &quot;passwd&quot; (found 
      in the installation directory). The default web interface URL is 
      http://yourhost:8080/webas2/ now.<br>*The underlaying database engine 
      has been upgraded and the structure is incompatible, it is HSQLDB 2.x.x 
      now. That means that an additional update script has to be started once 
      if you upgrade from an earlier version of mendelson opensource AS2. The 
      AS2 server will inform you if such an external update is required and 
      how to perform it.<br>*The database has been splitted, there is a 
      configuration database and a runtime database now. The split will be 
      performed on the first server start if the software is updated from an 
      older version of the mendelson AS2<br><br>Changes:<br>*The JMS interface 
      has been removed<br><br>Fixes:<br>*There has been a wrong format for 
      december in the HHTP header if the locale is FR<br>*The MDN wait time 
      starts at the message send time now, was at message creation time<br><br><br>Updates:<br>Update 
      to commons IO 2.1<br>Update to VAADIN 6.7.3<br>Update to HSQLDB 2.2.7<br><br>Hint:<br>The 
      mendelson opensource AS2 will run fine with Java 64 bit VMs. If you have 
      problems with the memory consumption please install a 64 bit java VM 
      (not included), patch the VM with the &quot;jurisdiction policy strength 
      files&quot; (Oracle download) and set the main memory of the JVM to 4 GB<br><br><br><br>09/2011 
      mendelson opensource AS2 1.1 b37<br><br>This is a maintenance release - 
      it just fixes one configuration problem - it does not contain any change 
      in the processing unit<br><br>Enhancement:<br>*A progress bar has been 
      added for some operations in the client<br>*Added the AS2 message 
      subject to the event replacements<br><br>Fixes:<br>*The default value 
      for the SSL keystore password was wrong, this leaded to the error 
      message &quot;Keystore was tampered with, or password was incorrect&quot; if you 
      try to send messages<br>*Fixed a unmarshalling problem at config import<br>*No 
      notification mail has been send on send error<br>*Error in the french 
      versions localization at the partners event screen<br>*The user was

      to HttpClient 4.1.2<br><br><br>08/2011 mendelson opensource AS2 1.1 b35<br><br>Enhancement:<br>*A 
      status file for outbound transactions has been added again, this was 
      removed in the prior version<br>*New logdata structure: There is a 
      logfile per day now in a single sub directory, the format is 
      log/CCYYMMDD/as2n.log<br>*To prevent flooting your partners AS2 server 
      with messages the max number of messages to send per poll attempt could 
      be defined in the partner settings now. All existing polls are set to 
      the default value of 100 outbound transactions per poll. Please modify 
      these settings if it does not fit your needs after an update.<br>*User 
      interface: a progress bar has been added for some operations (e.g. 
      storing the partner settings)<br>*The delivered keystore contains now 
      the mendelson CA root certificate as trusted certificate<br>*If a 
      certificate/key has been deleted outside of the application (e.g. by 
      using portecle) this is displayed<br>in the related combobox now by a 
      special icon<br><br>Fixes:<br>*The private key of an entry has not been 
      found if there are two similar entries<br>in the keystore (one key pair 
      and one public key)<br>*Problems sending XML data have been fixed. The 
      problem occured if the data has been transmitted uncompressed, unsigned 
      and unencrypted (which is very uncommon)<br>*The partner/user specific 
      events have not been processed for outbound connection problems<br>*If 
      the signature of an MDN could not be verified the transaction was 
      disregarding this fact set to green<br>*The linux start script ignored 
      the command line parameters<br>*There was a problem in setting up the 
      HTTP authentication for data upload/MDN in the partner panel<br>*If an 
      MDN had a content transfer encoding set there occured a processing error 
      on the MDN. The error<br>message was &quot;The MDN references a AS2Message 
      with the message id &quot;null&quot; that does not exist.&quot;<br><br>Updates:<br>Update

      original filename now if mendelson opensource AS2 is the receiver (and 
      the sender sent the necessary information), could be defined per partner<br>*Added 
      content length header for sync MDN to improve compatibility to other as2 
      servers<br>*2 different keys for encryption/signature possible<br>*SQL 
      connection pool implemented<br>*Related software update: updated 
      Bouncycastle to 1.38, Joram to 5.0.7, implemented MINA framework<br>*As 
      always there are a lot of smaller improvements and fixes as discussed in 
      the mendelson community forum.<br><br><br><br>09/24/2007 mendelson 
      opensource AS2 1.0 b19<br><br><br>*Execute a user defined command after 
      receipt of as2 messages per partner<br>*mendelson opensource AS2 could 
      send files with blanks in its filenames now<br>*Compatibility issue: 
      HTTP 202 is accepted beneath HTTP 200<br>*HTTP auth supported<br>*Usability: 
      Its impossible to assign a cert instead of a key to the local station now<br>*Transaction 
      overview: The model-view problems for column sorting have been fixed<br><br><br>05/10/2007 
      mendelson opensource AS2 1.0 b17<br><br>*Data compression is supported 
      (AS2 1.1 feature). It could be set up per partner. Please remember that 
      your TP has to support AS2 1.1 or higher for this feature<br>*MDN 
      options have been ignored so far (disposition-notification-options). Now 
      it is possible to ask mendelson opensource AS2 for unsigned MDN or 
      single signature algorithm only. mendelson opensource AS2 will still ask 
      for signed MDN and allow SHA-1 and MD5 in answers.<br>*If the inbound 
      message contains attachments (AS2 1.2 feature) mendelson opensource AS2 
      now returns a processing error MDN with the message that attachments are 
      not supported.<br><br><br><br><br>03/13/2007 mendelson opensource AS2 
      1.0 b15<br><br>*Fixed a problem that occured if sender or receiver alias 
      were names that lead to invalid filenames, the related files are stored 
      to the filesystem<br>*Web interface to monitor the server. The default 
      URL is http://localhost:8080/mec_as2/monitoring.jsp, user: guest, 
      password: guest<br>*Fixed a bug in the proxy support<br>*File storage 
      system has been rewritten<br>*Better overview on in- and outbound 
      messages: raw file decrypted, message header, payload data in separate 
      tabs<br>*Inbound parsing of original filename implemented<br><br><br><br>01/19/2007 
      mendelson opensource AS2 1.0 b13<br><br>*The server has a persistent 
      message queue now as processing queue, based on JMS. The server 
      integration could now be realized not only by sending files to an outbox 
      dir of a specified partner but also by sending data to the JMS server.<br>*It's 
      possible to define a directory poll interval per partner<br>*Its 
      possible to define a file pattern ignore list per partner for the 
      directory polls. This allows to copy file to the partners outbox 
      directory and enable the poll on the file by renaming it<br>*The GUI 
      &quot;send message to partner&quot; operation no longer copies the file into the 
      polled outbox dir but sends it directly to the as2 server message queue<br>*Related 
      software update: updated HSQLDB to v1.8.0_7, Bouncycastle to 1.35.<br>*Enhanced 
      server log to create links between processed filenames and the AS2
