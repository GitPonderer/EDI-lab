# EDI Learning Summary Day 1

## What is EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)

EDI is a standardized way for businesses to exchange documents electronically. Instead of sending paper invoices, purchase orders, or shipping notices, companies can transmit these documents directly between their computer systems using agreed upon formats.

## Common EDI Standards

### EDIFACT (Electronic Data Interchange For Administration, Commerce and Transport)
International standard developed by the UN. Used primarily in Europe and internationally. Segments are separated by single quotes ('). Elements within segments separated by plus signs (+). Example: UNH+1+ORDERS:D:03B:UN:EAN008'

### X12
Standard developed in North America by ANSI. Widely used in the United States. Segments end with tilde (~). Elements separated by asterisks (*). Example: ISA*00* *00* *ZZ*SENDER *ZZ*RECEIVER

### Other Standards
TRADACOMS: UK retail standard. XML: Modern approach using Extensible Markup Language. JSON: Lightweight data interchange format.

## EDI Document Types

### Common Transaction Sets
850/ORDERS: Purchase Orders. 810/INVOIC: Invoices. 856/DESADV: Advance Ship Notice. 997/CONTRL: Functional Acknowledgment.

### Document Structure
EDI documents follow a hierarchical structure:
1. Interchange: Outer envelope containing sender/receiver info
2. Functional Group: Groups related transaction sets
3. Transaction Set: The actual business document
4. Segments: Individual data elements within the document

## Bots EDI Overview

Bots EDI is an open source EDI translator that can convert between different EDI formats, transform EDI to/from XML, CSV, databases, handle file based and network communication, provide mapping scripts for data transformation, and offer web based monitoring and configuration.

### Key Components
Engine: Background processor that handles EDI transformations. Web Monitor: Browser based interface for configuration and monitoring. Channels: Define how files are received or sent (FILE, FTP, HTTP, etc.). Routes: Define the transformation workflow from input to output. Mappings: Python scripts that transform data between formats. Grammars: Define the structure of EDI message types.

## Learning Objectives Achieved

### Technical Setup
Installed Bots EDI with proper Python environment. Configured SQLite database for storing configuration. Set up web interface for monitoring and configuration. Created sample mapping script for ORDERS to CSV conversion.

### EDI Processing Flow
1. Receive: Files arrive via configured channels
2. Parse: EDI structure is validated against grammar
3. Transform: Mapping scripts convert data to target format
4. Output: Transformed data is sent via output channels

### Practical Application
Created ord_to_csv.py mapping script. Learned how EDI segments and elements are accessed. Understanding of how business data flows through EDI systems. Experience with debugging and troubleshooting EDI installations.

## Key Takeaways

EDI remains crucial for B2B commerce despite being decades old. Modern EDI systems like Bots EDI make it accessible by providing visual configuration interfaces, support for modern programming languages (Python), integration with current technologies (web interfaces, databases), and open source flexibility for customization.

The combination of standardized message formats with flexible transformation tools enables businesses to automate their document exchange processes, reducing manual data entry and improving accuracy in supply chain operations.
